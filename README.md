# Game Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA): Pandemic

This is a game developed by professor Martí Oller for the course of Data Structures and Algorithms of the faculty of Informatics of Barcelona (FIB) at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC).

Part of the evaluation of this course consisted in the performance of the algorithm in the game developed by each student. The performance was evaluated taking into account the competition results of the algorithm against those of the other students. 

In each round, one student was eliminated through a pyramid competition. Multiple games of 4 players were played and the 2 losers were pitted against other losing players up to one eliminated player per round who had lost all the matches.

My personal algorithm reached round 266/283, being one of the 18 best algorithms of the promotion (having 284 students). Multiple versions were developed as the version could be updated during the course of the rounds, taking into account the weaknesses of the algorithm when competing against others. However, "**AIVerstappen**" was the last version before being defeated.
